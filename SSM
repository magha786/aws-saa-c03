Pre-requisites

EC2 Instance must have:

The SSM Agent installed (Amazon Linux 2 and latest Ubuntu AMIs usually have it pre-installed).

An IAM Role attached with at least this policy:

AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore


Outbound internet access (or VPC endpoint for SSM).

Your user (in AWS Console or CLI) must have permissions for:

AmazonSSMFullAccess

Method 1: Connect via AWS Console

Go to EC2 → Instances.

Select your instance.

Click Connect → Session Manager → Connect.
✅ You’ll get a shell directly in your browser.

Method 2: Connect via AWS CLI

Make sure AWS CLI is configured:

aws configure


(Enter your access key, secret key, region, and output format)

Run this command to start a session:

aws ssm start-session --target i-xxxxxxxxxxxxx


Replace i-xxxxxxxxxxxxx with your EC2 Instance ID.

✅ This drops you into a terminal session on the instance.
